        <h1>Welcome to South Rwenzori Diocese!</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>A History of the Diocese</h2>
            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p>The creation of South Rwenzori Diocese is also linked to the struggle for the BambaBakonzo for self-administration. The yearning for an independent and separate district from Toro also crept into the church, which, like in local government, the church was headed by people who were not natives to the area. As parishes were created in the mountain areas, it became extremely necessary for the church to have local people to help in the spread of the message of salvation. It is no wonder, therefore, that the first voices for a separate diocese began from Kitholhu parish, where pastoral work became difficult for a Kabarole –based bishop amidst the agitation for separate administration. Below is the chronology of events that led to the creation of South Rwenzori Diocese.</p>
            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1973: Late Peter K. Muhyana becomes a member of the synod in Rwenzori Diocese and member of the Provincial assembly of Church of Uganda</li>
                <li>1974: Government grants Kasese a District status.
                <li>1979: Muhyana, then treasurer and secretary of Kitojo parish in the Kasese archdeaconry, moots the idea of establishing an Anglican Diocese in Kasese 1978 -1979 and the challenges. The then Bishop Rwenzori Diocese, Rt. Rev Yonasani Rwakaikara, falls ill, hampering Muhyana from advancing his dream with the Bishop. The illness disrupts two consecutive confirmation classes meant to be conducted by the Bishop, further strengthening the desire for an assistant bishop based in Kasese. Meanwhile, members of the Rwenzururu movement warn Bishop Rwakaikara against executing his duties in Kasese District, and direct church authorities in Kasese District not to remit any fund to Rwenzori Diocese. The Rwenzururu fighters periodically descend the mountains; carrying a way the Church funds for ‘’ Safe custody’’ pending the creation of a separate diocese in Kasese. The fighers also stopped Kasese Church officials and synod representatives from attending the synod and other meetings in Rwenzori Diocese on the grounds that Rwenzururu was fighting for the church in Kasese District. The fighters kidnapped and detained Kasese priests, catechists and missioners including Rev. Yohana Masereka, Rev. Hosea Kiiza; and other catechists and missioners. Consequences reduced church activities and services in Kasese archdeaconry, the displacement of the Kitojo vicar from his parish to Karambi. But thus enhancing the vision to have a separate diocese. Muhyana successfully tables a motion calling for an assistant bishop in charge of Kasese, a resolution sent to Kasese archdeaconry Council. The archdeaconry council debates, adopts and forwards the petition to the Diocesan synod of Rwenzori on 11th Dec. 1979 for consideration.
