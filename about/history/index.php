      <h2>Origins of the Diocese</h2>
      <p>The creation of South Rwenzori Diocese is linked to the struggle for the Bamba-Bakonzo for
        self-administration. The yearning for an independent and separate district from Toro also crept into the
        church, which, like the local government, was headed by people who were not natives to the area. As
        parishes were created in the mountain areas, it became necessary for the church to have local people to
        help in spread the message of salvation. It is no wonder, therefore, that the first voices for a
        separate diocese came from Kitholhu parish, where pastoral work became difficult for a Kabarole–based
        bishop amidst the agitation for separate administration. Below is the chronology of events that led to
        the creation of South Rwenzori Diocese.</p>

            <h3>1979</h3>
            <p>Muhyana, then treasurer and secretary of Kitojo parish in the Kasese archdeaconry, moots the
              idea of establishing an Anglican Diocese in Kasese in 1978-1979. The then Bishop of Rwenzori
              Diocese, Rt. Rev Yonasani Rwakaikara, falls ill, hampering Muhyana from advancing his dream
              with the Bishop. The illness disrupts two consecutive confirmation classes meant to be
              conducted by the Bishop, further strengthening the desire for an assistant bishop based in
              Kasese. Meanwhile, members of the Rwenzururu movement warn Bishop Rwakaikara against
              executing his duties in Kasese District, and direct church authorities in Kasese District
              not to remit any funds to Rwenzori Diocese.</p>
            <p>The Rwenzururu fighters periodically descend
              from the mountains, carrying away the church funds for 'safe custody' pending the creation
              of a separate diocese in Kasese. The fighters also stop Kasese church officials and synod
              representatives from attending the synod and other meetings in Rwenzori Diocese on the
              grounds that Rwenzururu was fighting for the church in Kasese District.
              The fighters kidnap and detain Kasese priests, catechists and missioners, including Rev. Yohana Masereka and
              Rev. Hosea Kiiza. The consequences are reduced church activities and services in Kasese
              archdeaconry and the displacement of the Kitojo vicar from his parish to Karambi, which
              enhance the vision to have a separate diocese.</p>
            <p>Muhyana successfully tables a motion calling
              for an assistant bishop in charge of Kasese, and a resolution is sent to the Kasese
              archdeaconry council. The archdeaconry council debates, adopts and forwards the petition to
              the diocesan synod of Rwenzori on 11th December 1979 for consideration. David Sebuhinja, one
              of the officials in the Rwenzori Diocese, supports the petition.</p>
