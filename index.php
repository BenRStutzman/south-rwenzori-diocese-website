            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            <p>South Rwenzori Diocese was carved from the Ruwenzori Diocese on 26th August, 1984, with the Rt. Rev. Zebedee Kahangwa Masereka as the first bishop. Rt. Rev. Jackson Nzerebende served as the second bishop, and our current bishop is the Rt. Rev. Nason Baluku.</p>

          <h2>Geographical Location</h2>
          <p>South Rwenzori Diocese is located in the Southwest of Uganda and covers the same area as Kasese District. To the south is Lake Edward and to the west is the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is set across the Equator and at a longitude of 33 degrees E, with an area of 5800 square kilometers.</p>
          <p>Below is a map of Kasese District showing the archdeaconries of South Rwenzori Diocese:</p>

          <p>The Diocese is found in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains and the lowlands of the Western Rift Valley. Despite being on the Equator, the Rwenzori Mountains (the Mountains of the Moon) rise to snowcapped peaks and dominate most of the district. The lowlands are over 600 metres above sea level, while the highest peaks are over 5,000 metres above sea level. On the eastern side, the mountains slope down to a plain. At the foot of the mountains is Kasese Town, the administrative centre for the district. Kasese is also home to the Diocesan Office and St. Paul’s Cathedral.</p>
